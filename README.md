# GitHub Pages Deployment with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website to **GitHub Pages** using **GitHub Actions**.

## How it works
- The workflow (`deploy.yml`) runs whenever `index.html` is changed and pushed to the `main` branch.
- It builds and deploys the website to GitHub Pages.
- Website is accessible at: `https://github.com/santoshk51/deployment-workflow`
